# MuscleModel
This repo contains a set of mathematical models for a muscle, which can be used with any artificial muscle. The parameters, equations, etc have been defined in a separate report, which will be uploaded shortly. If the report is unavailable to be uploaded, the explanation shall be done here.

Update:
The repo has been updated with the final report I submitted at the aftermath of my internship at Technische Universitat Munchen. While the work has been independently published by a research group in UK, nevertheless, it has been our brainchild for a long time, and had been left unpublished for lack of Muscle-morphic hardware availability. 

The report can also be found online at [Media TUM](https://mediatum.ub.tum.de/doc/1324772/file.pdf)
